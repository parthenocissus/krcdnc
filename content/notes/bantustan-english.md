      html: "<p><em>Bantustan: Atlas of an African Journey</em> is a book of travel prose and hand-drawn maps written and created by Lazar Pašćanović, Marko Đedović, and me.<sup id='s1'>1</sup> Describing a journey from Serbia to Namibia, we tried to imagine new cartographies of human relationships on a shared globe.</p>
      <p><em>Bantustan</em> is a story about our 3-month travel across Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, D. R. Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, and Namibia in 2010. The travel project itself could be interpreted in the context of psychogeography and experimental geography.<sup id='s2'>2</sup> Using hitch-hiking and digital hospitality platforms, we have tried to meet as a diverse pool of people as possible. Many of them we found thanks to the communitarian philosophy of early CouchSurfing. The question of physical experience of the connected world mediated via digital platforms plays an important role in the narrative.</p>
      <p>Including a series of hand-illustrated maps, infographics, literary interfaces, and data visualizations for non-linear reading, <span class='italic-style'>Bantustan</span> is an example of ergodic and interactive literature.<sup id='s3'>3</sup> Readers can choose how to read the book: in a traditional linear fashion or using maps as visual interfaces for jumping from one story to another.</p>
      <p>I've drawn all maps and visuals by hand, digitally, using a drawing tablet. Maps represent a tapestry of pictograms, ideograms, different writing systems, coats of arms, labyrinths, secret messages, and other hidden symbols for readers to discover and decypher. The drawing process lasted a year.</p>"
