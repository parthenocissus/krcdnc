lead: "Random graphic diary of the epidemic, started in January 2020. Market lists. To-do lists. Sketches for this site and other projects. Asemic charts. Pieces of administration for schools, exhibitions and workshops. Small life plans. Personal inventory. Redacted data. Diagram meditations. Crypto-scribbles."

      html: "<p>I started making this diary in January 2020, using an ordinary black felt-tip pen (0.2) and (sometimes) wooden colors, also ordinary, like the ones I used in elementary school. The diary is unintentional and mostly meaningless,<sup id='s1'>1</sup> like a simple meditation. My friends convinced me to scan it and upload it here. Some say it reminds them of encrypted data streams, others read them as obsessive footprints of epidemic isolation. Some have tried in vain to interpret them. There is nothing to interpret: that's why I drew them, so that I wouldn't have to think.</p>"
