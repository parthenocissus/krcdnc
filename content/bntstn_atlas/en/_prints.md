<p>The first solo exhibition of illustrated maps I've created for the travel novel Bantustan will take place on April 18, 2022, 19:00, in the Student City Cultural Centre (DKSG) in Belgrade. Visitors will be able to buy serigraphy prints on quality paper. We chose 4 maps: Nairobi, Tanganyika, Namibia and el Idrisi. The maps are printed in limited series of 50 copies. Dimensions: 70 x 50 cm. Prints are numbered and signed.</p>
