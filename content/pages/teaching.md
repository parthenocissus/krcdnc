I also work as a <a href='http://goodoldai.org/' target='_blank'>Research Associate and Visiting Lecturer at the Good Old AI Lab</a>, Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, Serbia.</p> 
<p>At the Faculty of Media and Communications, I try to foster a transdisciplinary studio environment in collaboration with <a href='https://fmk.singidunum.ac.rs/profesori/isidora-nikolic/' target='_blank'>Isidora Nikolić</a>, <a href='https://fmk.singidunum.ac.rs/profesori/borut-vild/' target='_blank'>Borut Vild</a>, and <a href='https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/darija-medic' target='_blank'>Darija Medić</a>.</p> 
<p>Along with teaching, I have created a group of interactive art courses for the Department of Digital Art, which was seen as a pioneering effort within Serbian high education system. Courses include:</p>

      text: "<p>Occasionally, I teach at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petnica_Science_Center' target='_blank'>Petnica Science Center</a> Design Programme. Petnica is a talent campus for high school students from Serbia and the Balkans, located between a forest, a lake, and a cave near the city of Valjevo. Yearly design programme in Petnica consists of several one- and two-week seminars, where 15-30 selected students learn about basics of design and other creative endeavours by making their own projects. Topics range from graphic, industrial, and interactive design to visual art, creative writing, creative coding, video and animation.</p>
<p>Design Programme was founded by <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/borut_vild' target='_blank'>Borut Vild</a> and developed by <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/isidora_nikolic' target='_blank'> Isidora Nikolić</a> and <a href='https://www.fsu.edu.rs/en/professor-vesna-pejovic/' target='_blank'>Vesna Pejović</a>. It is currently led by Igor Rajković and Teodora Ćirić, with a group of exceptional junior assistants, including Miloš Nikolić, Jelena Pejović, Saša Mitrović, Tijana Radovanović, Nada Todorović, Una Korica, Sonja Jovanović, Miloš Desko Ćosović, Boban Živanović, Marija Pilčević, Ivan Avdić, and others.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I was a young astronomy student in Petnica. I find this experience valuable for our common goal of creating new constellations of anti-disciplinary knowledge across design, art, science, and tech.</p>"

Thus, a relation has been established between the canonical structure of an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon' target='_blank'>Orthodox icon</a> and the image artificially created through computer program. In 2020 the project was presented at <a href='https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/de/kristina-tica/' target='_blank'>Ars Electronica</a>.</p>
