lead: "A series of procedural, generative and animated visual experiments inspired by the shape of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The visuals were created as supporting material for this year's workshops and <a href='/work/teaching/'>academic courses</a>, guided by the idea that the imagination should be built <em>upon</em> biological, technological and material reality, not <em>past</em> it, especially when it is invisible."

Graphic variations are endless, yet all mutations share the same structural pattern, its design based on microscopic photographs of the <a href = 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-unveiled.html' target = '_blank'>SARS-CoV-2</a> virus. The resulting pictograms form a new language, a new system of symbols, which can be used and interpreted in various ways. One of the goals: to develop sensibility, a kind of aesthetic understanding, towards the complex biological, climatic and material systems that determine – and will continue to determine – the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

How to use these glyphs? A concrete example is the <a href='/space/neolib' target='_blank'>interactive typographic piece</a>, which uses this system to display the letter »o« – the only visual difference between the terms »neoliberal« and »illiberal« in Serbian (»neoliberalni« vs. »neliberalni«) – as a biological cell infected with a virus. Created as part of my workshops and academic courses this year, the piece was inspired by the essay <a href='https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/' target='_blank'><em>Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism?</em></a> (Jodi Dean, LARB), which we analyzed together in classes.
 
 There is also a generator of new symbols, which allows you to create your own shapes modeled on a common pattern. Dragging the mouse over the image changes the parameters, and by clicking on the image you can save it as a PNG file:

The software is written in <a href='https://p5js.org/' target='_blank'> p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for non-programmers, artists, writers and designers. The <em>2020 mutation</em> code is uploaded on my <a href='https://github.com/parthenocissus/2020mutations' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> and in my public database of <a href='https://editor.p5js.org/parthenocissus/sketches/' target ='_ blank'>p5.js sketch</a>, free and openly licensed (GNU General Public License v3.0), for anyone who would like to use it in their educational and design projects.

So far, <em>2020 mutations</em> have been shown at the <em>Fluid Design Forum</em>, University of Montenegro Faculty of Fine Arts, Cetinje, and during the Artist Talk at the Department of Digital Art, Faculty of Media and Communications, Belgrade, in autumn 2020.<mark>&#9632;</mark>
