lead: "Series of interactive data visualizations and generative infographics that track and show the readership of <a href='/work/projects/bantustan-book'><span class='italic-style'>Bantustan: Atlas of an African Journey</span> </a>, a book of travel prose written by Lazar Pašćanović, Marko Đedović, and me."

<a href='/work/projects/bantustan-book'><span class='italic-style'>Bantustan: atlas jednog putovanja</span></a> is a story about our 3-month travel across Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, D. R. Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, and Namibia. The book is an infographic cross-genre narrative about fluid geographic identities, unlikely connections, <a href='/work/projects/kp-identity'>Brownian</a> motion of human particles. It is about trying to imagine new cartographies of human relationships on a shared globe.

The symbol of the <span class='italic-style'>map</span> is important for several reasons. Including a series of hand-illustrated maps, infographics, and data visualizations for non-linear reading, <span class='italic-style'>Bantustan</span> is an example of <a href='https://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Ergodic_literature' target='_blank'>ergodic and interactive literature</a>. All maps and visuals have been meticulously drawn by hand, digitally, using a drawing tablet. Maps represent a tapestry of pictograms, different writing systems, coats of arms, labyrinths, and other hidden symbols.

The book was published as a community non-profit self-publishing project, via a crowdfunding campaing organized by <a href='http://www.thetravelclub.org/about-the-club' target='_blank'>The Travel Club</a> (<a href='http://www.klubputnika.org/o-klub-putnika' target='_blank'>Klub putnika</a>). It is available as <a href='http://www.klubputnika.org/tmp/Bantustan.pdf' target='_blank'>an openly licenced free electronic book</a> (currently only in Serbo-Croatian; we are working on the English version at the moment). 

The term <span class='italic-style'>bantustan</span>, with its <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantustan' target='_blank'>Apartheid undertone</a> and its <a href='http://monumenttotransformation.org/atlas-of-transformation/html/b/balkans/social-change-in-the-balkans-rastko-mocnik.html' target='_blank'>post-Yugoslav connotation</a>, is used as a symbol of both personal and collective segregation, isolation and self-isolation. The act of traveling is thus an <span class='italic-style'>anti-bantustan</span> act, just as the journey of the book itself, from one reader to another, is also an <span class='italic-style'>anti-bantustan</span> act. Creating unexpected connections and fluid spaces beyond any border – state, national, historical, psychological, economic.

A series of visualizations show these spaces and connections. There are precise statistics: where the book was ordered from, to which places, cities, countries and continents the book went. There are also artistic depictions of the connections between these places, which are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_art' target='_blank'>generated algorithmically</a> and are different each time. By changing the drawing parameters, users / readers / viewers can change the appearance of the map. Just as particles collide in a fluid, people and stories collide on these maps.

These maps are also a visual analysis of the muddy cultural space of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian' target='_blank'>pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language</a>. Although it is not impossible to recognize the borders of former and current countries on these maps, data visualization creates a new and authentic geography of readership.

Data visualizations were published on The Travel Club portal, in Serbo-Croatian, in the form of interactive articles or essays:

The project was presented in several cities, as part of regional literary promotions and forums. I've incorporated it into syllabi for the <a href='/work/teaching#academic'>subjects I created for the Department of Digital Art</a> at the Faculty of Media and Communications in Belgrade. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
