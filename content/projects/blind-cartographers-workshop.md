lead: "A workshop in <a href='/work/projects/category/cartography'>experimental cartography</a> and artistic map-making. By walking, sketching, talking with people on the streets, and studying the urban environment of Istanbul, Turkey, we collected stories and materials we presented in the form of subjective, personal, and artistic maps."

The workshop was organized by <a href='http://www.thetravelclub.org/about-the-club' target='_blank'>The Travel Club</a> (<a href='http://www.klubputnika.org/o-klub-putnika' target='_blank'>Klub putnika</a>), the main non-profit Balkan hub for independent travelers and travel writers. I was one of the Club's editors, organizers, and publishers for a couple of years. 

The workshop was part of The Travel Club's community funded <a href='http://www.thetravelclub.org/istanbul-travel-house'>Travel House</a> project. In short, the Club would organize a crowdfunding campaign, rent an apartment in a city for 2 months (in 2012. it was Istanbul), and create a fully-funded free travel culture residency programme. Accommodation was freely available for all applicants for a week.

As part of the programme, the workshop focused on exploring and mapping the hidden stories and symbols of the biggest Balkan city, referencing diverse map-related projects, books, and practices such as <a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2009/10/16/the-map-as-art/' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>Map as Art</span></a>, <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf" target="_blank"><span class='italic-style'>The Practice of Everyday Life</span></a>, <a href='http://tupress.org/books/maps-of-the-imagination' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer</span></a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International' target='_blank'>Situationist International</a>, <a href='https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/38923/experimental-geography/' target='_blank'>Experimental Geography</a>, <a href='http://wefeelfine.org/' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>We Feel Fine</a></a>, Aboriginal <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline' target='_blank'>Songlines</a>, Ottoman cartography of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis' target='_blank'>Piri Reis</a>, and many more.

Participants included people from all walks of life (travelers, artists, writers, musicians, programmers, carpenters, physical workers) and from different countries (Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Netherlands, Bosnia, Germany, Italy, USA).

Maps created during the workshop were presented at the Istanbul Travel House. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
