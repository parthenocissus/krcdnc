content: "<p class='regular'>While researching digital and generative identities for the <a href='/all-aligned' target='_blank'><em>All-Aligned</em> project</a>, I've discovered <strong>Hans Georg Moeller</strong>, a philosophy professor who currently teaches at the University of Macau. Bridging social systems theory, Tao and Zen philosophy, and materialist approaches to history, Moeller has written several books on systems, identities, digital profiles, and morality traps, such as <em><a href='http://cup.columbia.edu/book/you-and-your-profile/9780231196017' target='_blank'>You and Your Profile: Identity After Authenticity</a></em>, <em><a href='http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-moral-fool/9780231145084' target='_blank'>The Moral Fool: A Case for Amorality</a></em>, <em><a href='http://cup.columbia.edu/book/genuine-pretending/9780231183994' target='_blank'>Genuine Pretending: On the Philosophy of the Zhuangzi</a></em> and <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Luhmann-Explained-Souls-Systems-Ideas/dp/0812695984' target='_blank'>Luhmann Explained: From Souls to Systems </a></em>. Being an academic and a writer, Moeller is also an accomplished Youtuber. He is running two exellent YouTube channels, which I wholeheartedly recommend: <em><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@carefreewandering' target='_blank'>Carefree Wandering</a></em> and <em><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@philosophyinmotion' target='_blank'>Philosophy in Motion</a></em>.</p>
<p class='regular'>In his book on digital identities, Moeller identifies three technologies for identity production, which have developed throughout history:</p>
<p class='regular'><strong>1. Sincerity</strong> is the oldest identity technology. It refers to the old traditional social roles, which individuals assume at birth or during key moments in life. This is, for example, the identity of mother or father, son or daughter, peasant or warrior, Serb or Hungarian, Orthodox or Catholic, feudal lord or servant. Traditional society expects individuals to honestly identify with these roles, hence the term <em>sincerety</em>.</p>
<p class='regular'><strong>2. Authenticity</strong> arises in modernity. People reject their traditional roles and develop a new ideal: identity is what I discovered myself, what I made myself to be. Identity is a reflection of the authentic essence of me as a being. Typical examples: the identity of an artist or an activist. As an identity technology, authenticity presupposes that I, being an individual, a Cartesian subject, possess an authentic and enduring essence, and that I should strive to find it — to find myself. One could say that authenticity is still the identity production default for most of us.</p>

<p class='regular'>This is where Moeller sees a problem. What does the commandment — be yourself, be authentic — mean anyway? If you say to someone, <em>you have to determine your own identity</em>, you've put them in what is called <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu1lnTQM0Gw' target='_blank'><em>a double bind</em></a>: if they listen to you, they therefore obey your request; if they don't, they're not authentic by definition. I like that analysis. Every time some brand tells me to <em>be myself</em>, I wish not to be myself out of spite.</p>
<p class='regular'>On a deeper level, that essence of self that authenticity presupposes, does it even exist? The idea of <em>self</em>, or Self, is just another construct that our minds grasp at like a straw, another metaphysical absolute not very different from angels and jinns. Instead of being separate from the rest of the world, I believe we are psycho-physical processes woven into world's fabric. Structural forces — economic, social, natural, biological, historical — spread through us. Our consciousnesses are not absolute but relative and interactive. My natural and social being is not the same as my idea of me. Modern humans are enslaved to that idea, to that construction, to that specter of the absolute self, as much as traditional humans were enslaved via rigid social roles. The modern self-phantom we devote our lives to is what I sometimes call the <em>ego-addiction</em>.</p>
<p class='regular'>That is why Moeller formulates the third and latest identity production technology:</p>
<p class='regular'><strong>3. Profilicity</strong>. That's what I'm doing right now: I'm writing a post on my website, I'm creating an image of myself, I'm presenting myself in a certain way, I'm legitimizing myself in front of you, and therefore I'm starting to see myself through your eyes, I'm starting to define myself in terms of what I think you see in my profile. Referencing Walter Benjamin and Niklas Luhmann, Meller uses the term <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cSkb1KppNc' target='_blank'><em>a second order observation</em></a>. We learn to look by looking at other peoples' ways of looking.</p>
<p class='regular'>At first glance, Profilicity seems like a civilizational defeat. However, Moeller points out there are some good sides of this novel identity production technology. Just by removing the identity issue from our immediate awareness, we're able to gain some breathing space. While Sincerity implies that I sincerely identify as a son, a father or a serf, a Montenegrin, an Albanian or a German in every essence of my being, and while Authenticity implies that I have to grasp at my authentic individual Cartesian self all the time, and if I don't feel good, it must mean that I <em>haven't found myself</em>, Profilicity simply tells me: your profile is your face in front of the world, whether you like it or not, but you don't have to identify with it at all. You can be at ease, because you are much more than your so-called identity. Even the old Zen philosophers knew that you don't have to identify with every thought that wanders through your consciousness.</p>
