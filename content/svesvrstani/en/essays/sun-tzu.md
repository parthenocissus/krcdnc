content: "<p class='regular'>The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.</p>
<p class='regular'>Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.</p>
<p class='regular'>The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.</p>
<p class='regular'>In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.</p>
