content: "<p class='regular'>If you like the <em>All-Aligned</em> project, think about buying a unique flag as a physical object and a signed art piece.</p>
<p class='regular'>First generate a flag that you fancy using our software <a href='/all-aligned/generator' target='_blank'><strong>Generator</strong></a>. After you choose the flag you would like to have in a physical form, click on it and save it as a SVG and a PNG file. Send these files to my email:</p>
<p class='regular'><strong>uros@krcadinac.com</strong></p>
<p class='regular'>The price of one flag is <strong>25 euros</strong> or <strong>3000 Serbian dinars</strong>.</p>
<p class='regular'>You can pay in cash or via PayPal. For the PayPal all you need is my email: <strong>uros.krcadinac@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p class='regular'>After the payment is registered, we will ship you the flag or deliver it to you in person.</p>
<p class='regular'><br></p>
<p class='regular end-text'>As project authors, we garantee that there will be no more than one signed flag of each particular design. There will be no repetitions and duplicates.</p>
<p class='regular end-text'>The software itself is published <a href='/all-aligned/code' target='_blank'>on GitHub as a free open source project</a>. You are free to use it in your own practices as long as they are non-profit. By buying a flag you support our work and you make projects such as this one sustainable.</p>"
