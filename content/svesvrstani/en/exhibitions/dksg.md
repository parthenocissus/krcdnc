content: "<p class='regular'>The exhibition was organized after the artist-in-residency program realized within the international project <strong><a href='https://theylive.eu/' target='_blank'>They: Live – student lives revealed through context-based art practices</a></strong>. The residency, supported by the Creative Europe and the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia, took place on student campuses in Belgrade, Madrid, Rijeka, Podgorica, and Novi Sad. As part of the residency, the selected artists and curators spent a month on the student campus of their city.</p>
    <p class='regular'>In the spring of 2022, as a selected artist, Uroš Krčadinac moved to the Student City of Belgrade, with the intention of exploring student symbols, identities, and ways of life in the analog and digital world. Over 200 students participated in the workshops. They used the All-Aligned generator in order to choose/create their individual flags.</p>
    <p class='regular'>In June 2022, the exhibition took place in the Students' City Cultural Center (SCCC) Gallery in Belgrade. The exhibition showed the flags created during student workshops. It raised questions about the relationship between technology and ideology. When we choose a flag, did we really choose it ourselves or did we just get caught on an automated hook? While scrolling and liking release our dopamine and serotonin, is our freedom of choice just a delusion? Do we rule the symbols or do they rule us? And in general, are there aesthetic solutions for structural problems?</p>
